    comment: 'I have added a mention at the beginning of the Google Fit chapter to underline the unavalibility in the android application, but yes, I think that reading the whole article before is always a good practice :-)'

    comment: 'Hello G, thanks for your feedback, and happy to know it has worked for you. I am curious if you have done something particular so that your data are showing up in the android app? (I still have not succeeded myself) Have your submitted your application for review?  I have also received a mail saying that new Google Fit API policy will enforce by the end of the month, maybe my problem will be solved then :)'

    comment: 'Hello, it seems that xiaomi_mi_scale has been recently updated with a breaking change, using now an options.json file with a path hardcoded "/data/options.json" You may either read the new documentation (https://github.com/lolouk44/xiaomi_mi_scale) and put the new configuration file in the required path (or update the line 39 of Xiami_Scale.py with the new location), or use my fork of the previous version that was used to write this article (https://github.com/rpeyron/xiaomi_mi_scale)'
