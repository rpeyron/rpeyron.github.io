For further information, please refer to the site [TI-Calc](http://www.ticalc.org) from where comes the most of the information of this page.

## Hardware part

Make these cables is not a problem, except the bad quality of the jack 2.5mm connectors. To avoid these problems of compatibility with the TI connectors, you can split a TI-TI cable.

### Parallel port

The parallel port cable is from far the easiest to do, the cheapest, and the most efficient :

### Serial port

This cable is not easy to make and less efficient because of its limited speed and the lack of good software. :

## Software part

The best software is **gtklink** existing under Windows and under Linux. You can download here a version for [windows](/files/old-web/elec/cables/gtktilink.zip) and here for [Linux](/files/old-web/elec/cables/gtktilink.tar.gz). Please go to TI-CALC for the latest versions. If you use the windows version, you will need [port95nt.exe](/files/old-web/elec/cables/port95nt.exe).

You will find on [ the linking page of TiCalc](http://www.ticalc.org/basics/linking/software.html) the other software.

## Emulators

I cannot speak of TI software without speaking of the emulator Virtual TI. It emulates perfectly a large number of TI calculators, like the 89 and the 92. In addition, it is beautiful and has many interesting features as **debugging**, the **virtual link**, and **ROM Wizards**,…

You can find it on [this page](http://vti.acz.org/) the latest version of Virtual TI.
