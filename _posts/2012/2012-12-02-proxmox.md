# Accessing local hard drive

You can add local hard drives directly to a VM.

```
# qm set 101 add -scsi0 /dev/sdd
```

Where you have to replace :

- 101 with your VMid
- scsi0 with your dest driver (could be ideX, scsiX,…)
- /dev/sdd with the hard drive you want

Note that :

- you have to be very carefull that no more than a VM use a disk in the same time
- you must give the whole disk, not only a partition ; but then you will be able to mount only one partition of that disk

# Have a better VGA driver

Proxmox/KVM use by default the cirrus driver. But I have experienced some trouble using VNC with this driver. Instead you can use the std VGA driver. This driver works well, but you may only have 800×600 resolution on Linux. To have more, you can update the vgabios.bin file located in /usr/share/kvm with the one available on the Bochs website ([http://www.nongnu.org/vgabios/](http://www.nongnu.org/vgabios/ "http://www.nongnu.org/vgabios/"))

```
root@proxmox:~# cd /usr/share/kvm
root@proxmox:/usr/share/kvm# wget http://savannah.gnu.org/download/vgabios/vgabios-0.7a.bin
root@proxmox:/usr/share/kvm# mv vgabios-stdvga.bin vgabios-stdvga.bin.dist
root@proxmox:/usr/share/kvm# ln vgabios-0.7a.bin vgabios-stdvga.bin
```

Then stop your VM and start it again (restart is not enough), and it should be better.

# Accessing your VM

Use TigerVNC
