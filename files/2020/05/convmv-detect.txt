=head1 NAME

convmv - converts filenames from one encoding to another

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<convmv> [B<options>] FILE(S) ... DIRECTORY(S)

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-f ENCODING>

specify the current encoding of the filename(s) from which should be converted

=item B<-t ENCODING>

specify the encoding to which the filename(s) should be converted

=item B<-i>

interactive mode (ask y/n for each action)

=item B<-r>

recursively go through directories

=item B<--nfc>

target files will be normalization form C for UTF-8 (Linux etc.)

=item B<--nfd>

target files will be normalization form D for UTF-8 (OS X etc.).

=item B<--qfrom> , B<--qto>

be more quiet about the "from" or "to" of a rename (if it screws up your
terminal e.g.). This will in fact do nothing else than replace any non-ASCII
character (bytewise) with ? and any control character with * on printout, this
does not affect rename operation itself.

=item B<--exec> command

execute the given command. You have to quote the command and #1 will be
substituted by the old, #2 by the new filename. Using this option link 
targets will stay untouched.

Example:

convmv -f latin1 -t utf-8 -r --exec "echo #1 should be renamed to #2" path/to/files

=item B<--list>

list all available encodings. To get support for more Chinese or Japanese
encodings install the Perl HanExtra or JIS2K Encode packages.

=item B<--lowmem>

keep memory footprint low by not creating a hash of all files. This disables
checking if symlink targets are in subtree. Symlink target pointers will be
converted regardlessly. If you convert multiple hundredthousands or millions of
files the memory usage of convmv might grow quite high. This option would help
you out in that case.

=item B<--nosmart>

by default convmv will detect if a filename is already UTF8 encoded and will
skip this file if conversion from some charset to UTF8 should be performed.
C<--nosmart> will also force conversion to UTF-8 for such files, which might
result in "double encoded UTF-8" (see section below).

=item B<--fixdouble>

using the C<--fixdouble> option convmv does only convert files which will still
be UTF-8 encoded after conversion. That's useful for fixing double-encoded
UTF-8 files. All files which are not UTF-8 or will not result in UTF-8 after
conversion will not be touched. Also see chapter "How to undo double UTF-8 ..."
below.

=item B<--notest>

Needed to actually rename the files. By default convmv will just print what it
wants to do.

=item B<--parsable>

This is an advanced option that people who want to write a GUI front end will
find useful (some others maybe, too). It will convmv make print out what it
would do in an easy parsable way. The first column contains the action or some
kind of information, the second column mostly contains the file that is to be
modified and if appropriate the third column contains the modified value.  Each
column is separated by \0\n (nullbyte newline). Each row (one action) is
separated by \0\0\n (nullbyte nullbyte newline).

=item B<--preserve-mtimes>

modifying filenames usually causes the parent directory's mtime being updated.
This option allows to reset the mtime to the old value. If your filesystem
supports sub-second resolution the sub-second part of the atime and mtime
will be lost as Perl does not yet support that.

=item B<--replace>

if the file to which shall be renamed already exists, it will be overwritten if
the other file content is equal.

=item B<--unescape>

this option will remove this ugly % hex sequences from filenames and turn them
into (hopefully) nicer 8-bit characters. After --unescape you might want to do
a charset conversion. This sequences like %20 etc. are sometimes produced when
downloading via http or ftp.

=item B<--upper> , B<--lower>

turn filenames into all upper or all lower case. When the file is not
ASCII-encoded, convmv expects a charset to be entered via the -f switch.

=item B<--dotlessi>

care about the dotless i/I issue. A lowercase version of "I" will also be
dotless while an uppercase version of "i" will also be dotted. This is an
issue for Turkish and Azeri.

By the way: The superscript dot of the letter i was added in the Middle Ages to
distinguish the letter (in manuscripts) from adjacent vertical strokes in such
letters as u, m, and n. J is a variant form of i which emerged at this time and
subsequently became a separate letter.

=item B<--help>

print a short summary of available options

=item B<--dump-options>

print a list of all available options

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<convmv> is meant to help convert a single filename, a directory tree and the
contained files or a whole filesystem into a different encoding. It just
converts the filenames, not the content of the files. A special feature of
convmv is that it also takes care of symlinks, also converts the symlink target
pointer in case the symlink target is being converted, too.

All this comes in very handy when one wants to switch over from old 8-bit
locales to UTF-8 locales. It is also possible to convert directories to UTF-8
which are already partly UTF-8 encoded. convmv is able to detect if certain
files are UTF-8 encoded and will skip them by default. To turn this smartness
off use the C<--nosmart> switch.

=head2 Filesystem issues

Almost all POSIX filesystems do not care about how filenames are encoded, here
are some exceptions:

=head3 HFS+ on OS X / Darwin

Linux and (most?) other Unix-like operating systems use the so called
normalization form C (NFC) for its UTF-8 encoding by default but do not enforce
this.  Darwin, the base of the Macintosh OS enforces normalization form D
(NFD), where a few characters are encoded in a different way. On OS X it's not
possible to create NFC UTF-8 filenames because this is prevented at filesystem
layer.  On HFS+ filenames are internally stored in UTF-16 and when converted
back to UTF-8, for the underlying BSD system to be handable, NFD is created.
See http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1173.html for defails. I think it
was a very bad idea and breaks many things under OS X which expect a normal
POSIX conforming system. Anywhere else convmv is able to convert files from NFC
to NFD or vice versa which makes interoperability with such systems a lot
easier.

=head3 JFS

If people mount JFS partitions with iocharset=utf8, there is a similar problem,
because JFS is designed to store filenames internally in UTF-16, too; that is
because Linux' JFS is really JFS2, which was a rewrite of JFS for OS/2. JFS
partitions should always be mounted with iocharset=iso8859-1, which is also the
default with recent 2.6.6 kernels. If this is not done, JFS does not behave
like a POSIX filesystem and it might happen that certain files cannot be
created at all, for example filenames in ISO-8859-1 encoding. Only when
interoperation with OS/2 is needed iocharset should be set according to your
used locale charmap.

=head3 NFS4

Despite other POSIX filesystems RFC3530 (NFS 4) mandates UTF-8 but also says:
"The nfs4_cs_prep profile does not specify a normalization form.  A later
revision of this specification may specify a particular normalization form." In
other words, if you want to use NFS4 you might find the conversion and
normalization features of convmv quite useful.

=head3 FAT/VFAT and NTFS

NTFS and VFAT (for long filenames) use UTF-16 internally to store filenames.
You should not need to convert filenames if you mount one of those filesystems.
Use appropriate mount options instead!

=head2 How to undo double UTF-8 (or other) encoded filenames

Sometimes it might happen that you "double-encoded" certain filenames, for
example the file names already were UTF-8 encoded and you accidently did
another conversion from some charset to UTF-8. You can simply undo that by
converting that the other way round. The from-charset has to be UTF-8 and the
to-charset has to be the from-charset you previously accidently used.  If you
use the C<--fixdouble> option convmv will make sure that only files will be
processed that will still be UTF-8 encoded after conversion and it will leave
non-UTF-8 files untouched. You should check to get the correct results by doing
the conversion without C<--notest> before, also the C<--qfrom> option might be
helpful, because the double utf-8 file names might screw up your terminal if
they are being printed - they often contain control sequences which do funny
things with your terminal window. If you are not sure about the charset which
was accidently converted from, using C<--qfrom> is a good way to fiddle out the
required encoding without destroying the file names finally.

=head2 How to repair Samba files

When in the smb.conf (of Samba 2.x) there hasn't been set a correct "character
set" variable, files which are created from Win* clients are being created in
the client's codepage, e.g. cp850 for western european languages. As a result
of that the files which contain non-ASCII characters are screwed up if you "ls"
them on the Unix server. If you change the "character set" variable afterwards
to iso8859-1, newly created files are okay, but the old files are still screwed
up in the Windows encoding. In this case convmv can also be used to convert the
old Samba-shared files from cp850 to iso8859-1.

By the way: Samba 3.x finally maps to UTF-8 filenames by default, so also when
you migrate from Samba 2 to Samba 3 you might have to convert your file names.

=head2 Netatalk interoperability issues

When Netatalk is being switched to UTF-8 which is supported in version 2 then
it is NOT sufficient to rename the file names. There needs to be done more. See
http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/2.0/htmldocs/upgrade.html#volumes-and-filenames
and the uniconv utility of Netatalk for details.

--qfrom    be quiet about the "from" of a rename (if it screws up your terminal e.g.)
--qto      be quiet about the "to" of a rename (if it screws up your terminal e.g.)
--exec c   execute command instead of rename (use #1 and #2 and see man page)
--list     list all available encodings
--lowmem   keep memory footprint low (see man page)
--nosmart  ignore if files already seem to be UTF-8 and convert if posible
--notest   actually do rename the files
--replace  will replace files if they are equal
--unescape convert%20ugly%20escape%20sequences
