	   *  - PBT_APMQUERYSUSPEND : Query if suspend is allowed => We do not do anything.
	   *  - PBT_APMSUSPEND      : Tell the program Windows is suspending => Close the connection.
	   * * when resuming :
	   *  - PBT_APMRESUMESUSPEND : Tell the program Windows is resuming from suspend mode => Re-open the connection.
	   *  - PBT_APMRESUMEAUTOMATICALLE : Tell the program that Windows has resumed from something. => Do nothing.
