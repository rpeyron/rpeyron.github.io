This is the GitHub repository of my personal website.

Go to [lprp.fr](https://www.lprp.fr) or [the GitHub Pages version](https://rpeyron.github.io)

It is created with Jekyll with a bunch of plugins and custom layout, built with GitHub actions and hosted with GitHub Pages. Want to know more about how it is done?  Please read [the migration to Jekyll post](https://www.lprp.fr/2022/10/migrate-to-jekyll/)
