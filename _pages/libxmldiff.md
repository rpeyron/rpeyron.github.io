### Technology

 Here is a sample output with diff:status attributes added by xmldiff :

```xml
<test diff:status="below" xmlns:diff="http://www.via.ecp.fr/~remi/soft/xml/xmldiff">
  <file diff:status="added" id="2"/>
  <att diff:status="modified" id="1" old="tata|toto" removed="|toto"/>
  <file att="tot|" diff:status="modified" id="12">
    <name diff:status="modified">toto.dat|toto.cfg</name>
    <!-- Test -->C'est toto !
  </file>
  <file diff:status="added" id="24"/>
  <tulipe diff:status="modified" id="42">Tulipe|Tulipe 2</tulipe>
  <toto diff:status="added">Titi !</toto>
  <section1 diff:status="below">
    <section2 diff:status="below">
      <section3>Test</section3>
      <section3 diff:status="removed">Test</section3>
    </section2>
  </section1>
</test>
```

libxmldiff diff two files, and output a file with **exactly the same structure** (unlike other xml diffing utilities), and containing an extra diff:status attribute.  
The meaning of this diff:status argument is :

- added : the element has been added.
- removed : the element has been removed.
- modified : either an argument or the text has been modified, the values will be outputted with the `|` separator : `before|after`.
- below : the element itself was not modified, but a child item was.

### How to use

### Library usage

```
#include "libxmldiff.h"
```

libxmldiff is a C library. It is extensively documented through [doxygen documentation](https://rpeyron.github.io/libxmldiff/html/) and a default xmldiff example is provided, demontrating all the possibilities.

### Command line usage

 The xmldiff example allow to use all the power of libxmldiff from command line :

xmldiff v0.2.9 - (c) 2004 - Remi Peyronnet - http://people.via.ecp.fr/~remi/
xmldiff - diff two XML files. (c) 2004-2006 - R√©mi Peyronnet
Syntax : xmldiff action [options] <parameters>
Actions
 - diff <before.xml> <after.xml> <output.xml>
 - merge <before.xml> <after.xml> <output.xml>
 - xslt <style.xsl> <input.xml> <output.xml> [param='value']
 - recalc <output.xml>
 - execute <script.xds> (xds = list of these commands)
 - load <filename> <alias>
 - save <filename> <alias>
 - close <alias> / discard <alias> (same as close without saving)
 - flush
 - options
 - print <string>
 - delete <from alias> <xpath expression>
 - dup(licate) <source alias> <dest alias>
 - rem(ark),#,--,;,// <remark>
 - print_configuration
 - ret(urn) <value>
Global Options : 
  --auto-save yes      : Automatically save modified files
  --force-clean no     : Force remove of blank nodes and trim spaces
  --no-blanks yes      : Remove all blank spaces
  --pretty-print yes   : Output using pretty print writer
  --optimize no        : Optimize diff algorithm to reduce memory (see doc)
  --use-exslt no       : Allow the use of exslt.org extended functions.
  --savewithxslt yes   : Save with <xsl:output> options the results of XSLT.
  --verbose 4          : Verbose level, from 0 (nothing) to 9 (everything).
Diff Options : 
  --ids '@id,@value'   : Use these item to identify a node
  --ignore '@ignore,..': Ignore differences on these items
  --diff-only no       : Do not alter files, just compare.
  --keep-diff-only no  : Keep only different nodes.
  --before-values yes  : Add before values in attributes or text nodes
  --sep |              : Use this as the separator
  --encoding none  : Force encoding
  --tag-childs yes     : Tag Added or Removed childs
  --merge-ns yes       : Create missing namespace on top of document
  --special-nodes-ids yes  : Content of special nodes (CData, PI,...) will be used as ids
  --special-nodes-before-value no  : Display changed value for special nodes (CData, PI,...)
  --diff-ns http://... : Namespace definition, use no to disable
  --diff-xmlns diff    : Alias to use, use no to disable
  --diff-attr status   : Name of attribute to use (should not be used in docs)
</output.xml></input.xml>
```

#### Basic examples

```
xmldiff execute script.txt param1.xml param2.xml param3.xsl
xmldiff diff before.xml after.xml diff.xml
xmldiff --use-exslt yes xslt transform.xsl input.xml output.xml
xmldiff print "Hello World !" (that is rather useless, but it can do it !)
```

#### Aliases and other commands

The commands ‚Äù load / save / discard / flush / close / options / remark ‚Äù are useless from the command line, but are designed to be used in scripts. All these functions uses *aliases* to access xml files. Aliases are references to xml files. You can specify alias names with the load command. When you use an alias which does not exist, xmldiff tries to load the file and creates the corresponding alias.  
Typically in ‚Äúload file.xml alias; diff alias file2.xml out.xml‚Äù, when processing the diff command, xmldiff will take the ‚Äúalias‚Äù alias as is, as it has previsouly been opened by the load command, and will load file2.xml ans create a ‚Äúfile2.xml‚Äù alias, as the file was not previously loaded. It will output the result in the alias out.xml. If ‚Äìauto-save is set, the alias ‚Äúout.xml‚Äù will be save to a ‚Äúout.xml‚Äù file.  
If you understood the previous paragraph you can use aliases to make your code easier to read. If not, just use them as standard file names, it works too üôÇ

### Scripting

XML Diff introduces scripting capabilities to make xslt transformation, differences computations, basic xml manipulation (nodes deletion,‚Ä¶) in a same environment, with higher performance as usual scripting (as xml files do not have to be saved / loaded each times).  
A script is called by the ‚Äúexecute‚Äù command. Several arguments can be used in the script (‚Äò$1‚Äô to ‚Äò$8‚Äô). All the commands / options described in the previous section can be used here. Here is a simple script sample :

```
# Script sample
options --auto-save no --optimize no
print "Pre-Processing..."
load $1 Before
xslt pre-processing.xsl Before Before
load $2 After
xslt pre-processing.xsl After After
diff Before After Diff
discard Before
discard After
xslt post-processing.xsl Diff Diff
save $3 Diff
print "Done."
```

### Script to merge two XML files

You will first need to create the script file named merge.xds, in the same folder as your XML files, and containing the text below : # Load files  
```
load $1 first  
load $2 second

# Do not keep values of the first file when element exists in the second one  
# Set elements identifier to attribute id  
# Disable namespace to avoid extra tag  
options ‚Äìbefore-values no ‚Äìids ‚Äò@id‚Äô ‚Äìdiff-ns no ‚Äìdiff-attr xmldiff\_status

# Do the diff  
diff first second output

# Remove nodes with diff:status=added, as they were not in the first fils  
delete output ‚Äò//\*\[@xmldiff\_status=‚Äùadded‚Äù\]‚Äô

# Remove diff:status attribute to get a clean file  
delete output //@xmldiff\_status

# Save the results  
save $3 output 
```

Then you will tell xmldiff to execute this script and provide the filenames : `xmldiff.exe execute merge.xds ui\_en.xml ui\_it.xml ui\_it\_merged.xml`
